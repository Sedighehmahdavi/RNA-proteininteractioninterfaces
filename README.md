# RNA-proteininteractioninterfaces
1.In frist step ,CGAL has to be installed . For information about CGAL, please refer to http://www.cgal.org/
2.This program isimplemented in  Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (c++) 
3.Each component in the interaction complex determined by  name of chains in component.
4.For RNA-protein and DNA-protein complexes ,please  enter number file '2' for this chains in proteins.
3 files are output of the program,output,nameatomif and numberres.
content of output file is  information of interaction interface.
content of nameatomif file is   name,residue and coordination of interface atom.
content of nameatomif file is   numbers of interface residue.
